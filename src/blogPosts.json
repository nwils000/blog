I'm starting to feel the burnout from using plain vanilla JavaScript, but there's light at the end of the tunnel because we're jumping into React next week, which I absolutely love! The biggest takeaway for me this week is that almost everything in JavaScript is an object... functions, arrays, etc. This realization has shifted how I understand and follow JavaScript code, making unfamiliar features more approachable. I love JavaScript, but manual DOM manipulation isn't my favorite, which is why I'm so excited to start working with React!",
      "Everyone keeps telling me that finding a job won't be a problem, but I can't help feeling skeptical. Is it just my insecurities? Despite these doubts, I'm pushing myself to network more actively, especially on LinkedIn. Just last week, I had lunch with the CEO of a local tech company. They aren't hiring junior developers right now, but things might change by the time I finish my bootcamp. We had a conversation, and he wanted to keep in touch. No promises, but it's given me a huge boost and the motivation to give my all to this bootcamp and my job search. Even though I'm naturally pessimistic, the experiences I'm gaining are slowly but surely helping me shed that negativity."

Pseudocode has saved me from countless hours of backtracking and redoing my work. By clearly defining my thoughts and the flow of operations in simple English first, I've been able to spot and address problems early on.",
      "I now see pseudocode as more than just a preliminary step but it's a crucial part of my coding process. It helps me layout and think through my projects, making the actual coding much smoother. It's also been great for working with others, as it makes my thought process clear and easy to follow.",
      "Moving forward, my goal is to deepen my understanding and use of pseudocode. I want to develop more comprehensive and precise pseudocode for all my projects. By doing so, I believe I can make my coding process not only faster but also significantly more accurate and less prone to errors."

      "Trying to code a social media platform without a framework would be very hard. Managing all the data flow, user interactions, and dynamic elements would be overwhelming without the structured support of a framework.",
      "`useReducer` functions similarly to `useState` but gives a more organized approach by centralizing all state logic in one place. I really enjoy using it because it helps managing state less convoluted, especially in complex components.",
      "Using both `useReducer` and `useContext` together is really efficient. You get the structured and centralized state management of `useReducer` along with the convenience of `useContext`, which allows you to avoid the dreaded prop drilling that comes with just `useState`. This combination simplifies passing state through your components."

      "I'm excited to delve deeper into Python and explore its applications, especially in backend development with Django. The more I learn, the more confident I feel about my coding skills.",
      "I have to watch how I code. I tend to stick with what I know. For example, I was completely content just using for loops to iterate over arrays and objects in JS but I had to force myself to use the built-in methods. Now I love them and hardly ever use traditional for loops. This week, I created a blackjack terminal game in Python. I made it in about 2 hours with a functional programming approach. Then I caught myself getting too comfortable and forced myself to only use classes to learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It took me 2 days to get as far as I did staying in my comfort zone. I need to consciously decide to take the seemingly harder routes that I know will be good for me and the projects in the long run.",
      "Overall, this week was great and I learned a lot about Python and OOP. Iâ€™m feeling really confident in my skills. I also did super well in a mock JS interview with Ember which boosted my confidence. I canâ€™t wait to keep learning more about Python and backend development!"

      "Backend development will take some getting used to, but I have learned that planning out the structure of a relational database really gets me excited. I think it's super fun to think about how everything relates to each other. The biggest sticking point I had was I erroneously linked two tables with a one-to-many relationship, but I really wanted a many-to-many. This caused me to spend all of Thursday refactoring my code.",
